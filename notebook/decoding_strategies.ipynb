Reducing k in top k increases the score, but it is still far below greedy. Decreasing temperature also worked very well, getting relatively close to greedy. I also increased the scores of top-p and contrastive search by decreasing their parameters, but they are still below greedy. Howeer, I think the best is beam search with 2 beams, as it is still quite fast a score higher enough to justify the extra computation.\n",

Contrastive search also produces very repetitive text, but increasing the penalty alpha helps a bit. Top-k and top-p produce the most diverse text, with top-p being slightly better. Increasing temperature makes it go off topic. I think the best is top-p with 0.99 as it at least doesnt start repeating itself or instantly go off topic."
